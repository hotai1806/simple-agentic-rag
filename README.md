# Simple AI Agent with RAG feature

### Overview

This repo contains a minimal Bot reply by finding knowledge in vector store:

1. Scrapes ≥30 support articles from **support.optisigns.com**
2. Converts them into clean Markdown (slug-based filenames)
3. Uploads + chunks them into an OpenAI **Vector Store** via API
4. Deploys a **daily DigitalOcean Scheduled Job** to re-scrape and upload only deltas
   (new/updated articles detected via hash comparison)
5. Assistant answers only from uploaded docs with citations

---

### Local Setup

```bash
cp .env.sample .env
# fill in OPENAI_API_KEY
```

---

### Run Locally (one-shot)

```bash
docker build -t optibot-mini .
docker run --rm \
  --env-file .env \
  -v "$(pwd)/optibot.json:/app/optibot.json" \
  optibot-mini:latest python main.py

```

This triggers:

- scrape
- clean markdown
- create assistant
- upload file to vector store
- link assistant to vector store
